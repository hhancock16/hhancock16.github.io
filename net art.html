			<p class="statementDescription">
		Taking from what basic HTML we were taught, we were to implement into a form of net art. I chose to create my project based of procrastination on the project itself. Other than the fact I actually for real procrastinated on this asignment, it kind of ties to the elment of procrastination, by having a messy unfinished look. In terms of technical aspects of this assignment, there were and still is a few alignment and formatting issues that wasn't intended. My overall concept behind this assignment was based off my personal struggle with attention deficit disorder, which often results to procrastination. Procrastination is often a result of distraction, but sometimes as hard as I try my brain just won't let me. By making interactive pages intended to function as the progress of getting the project done, but instead leads to something different, reflects the frustrating or even confusing aspects I experience.
