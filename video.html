		<p class="statementDescription">	
		There are periods where we don't see or talk to each other and when we do have the time it's not very long. I cherish every moment whenever we spend more than one day with each other. We're close yet so far.

		<h3 class="statementTitle">Process and Aesthetic Approach</h3>
	<p class="statementDescription">
			My original concept completely changed last second to expressing the societal standard of education, rendering students to become busier and busier. The struggle to balance a work, play, social life has become seemingly more difficult, impacting friendships and relationships. The audio is a ukulele cover of the song Unconditionally by Katy Perry and the audio of the clock ticking was recorded separate directly from the actual clock with Adobe Audition. I recorded the ukulele with the software GarageBand, tweaked a little bit of the digital presets for enhancement, not too much though because I want to keep the classic ukulele sound, then I exported it as a wav file. The song Unconditionally was personal choice to play as it reflects my interpretation of the word unconditional and represents meaning to a fairly recent major life event. Next I imported the ukulele and clock wav files into an Adobe Audition multitrack. After adjusting the clock audio I exported both files as one wav file and imported it into Adobe Premiere Pro. From there I edited the video files to blend in the audio. My visual approach for this video was to portray a third person point of view for the most part, since I'm also a major part of the video. Even though there were many shots I wanted to shoot handheld, most of the shots were mounted on a tripod. I also attempted to limit the beginning shots to be more noisy/dark and the second half of shots to be brighter, in order to emphasize my feelings.
